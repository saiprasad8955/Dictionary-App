# Dictionary-App

The task is to create a simple Vocabulary web app (Designed inspired by material.io/design/material-studies/crane.html) as shown in the attached Video, considering the following details:  

-Use Oxford Dictionaries Developer APIs to accomplish the task. (Register on developer.oxforddictionaries.com and use the API key in the prototype free version)  

-The user must be able to add a new word on the app, which would be asynchronously fetched on the backend using the appropriate Oxford REST API. 

- Every word fetched from Oxford API, must be locally cached using MongoDB. 

- You must be able to view the added words and search for them. 

- Words List and Search should be built on top of the data cached in MongoDB and should never interact with the Oxford APIs directly. 

- Build the app using JavaScript only. Backend using Node.js and Frontend using React + Redux. You could use Next.js if it's any help to build an isomorphic web app. - Material UI library can be used for UI components. 

- Show the details of each word on click of the card, on a full screen modal. 

- Use Kumbh Sans font throughout the application. (fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumbh+Sans?query=Sans) 

- Every line of the code must be written by you with proper comments and explanations wherever necessary. 

- The code must be well structured and should be performant. 

- The UI is expected to be appealing and almost match the app in the attached screenshots. 

- Using GraphQL to expose data to the client-side will be given a preference and additional points.
